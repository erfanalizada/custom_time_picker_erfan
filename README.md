## üìã Behavior Details

Editing: When the user taps on the time display, it switches to a TextField for direct input.

### Validation:

Only 4 digits allowed (HHMM).

Auto-formats input to HH:MM style.

Restricts selection to valid times (e.g., prevents selecting 25:61).

If today is selected as date: you cannot select future hours/minutes compared to now.

Scroll Sync: After manual typing, the scroll wheels jump automatically to the correct position if input is valid.


## üé® UI and Theming

Primary Color: Used for highlights, headers, selected numbers, confirm button.

Background Color: Dialog background.

Error Color: Applied to text input if invalid.

Text Colors: Applied across the widget.

Disabled Color: Applied to disabled states (like a disabled confirm button).


## ‚ùì FAQ
Q: Can I disable editing?
No, editing is always allowed by tapping the time field. You can customize the icon to guide users though.

Q: Does it support AM/PM format?
Not directly; it uses 24-hour format for simplicity. You can convert it manually using Flutter's built-in methods if needed.

Q: Does it block future dates?
Only future times for today are blocked. Future dates allow any time.
